# TodoMVC app in React with Dgraph as a GraphQL storage layer

You can read a step by step walkthrough of how we built this at the [Dgraph Blog](https://blog.dgraph.io/post/building-todo-list-react-dgraph/)

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
